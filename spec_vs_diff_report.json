  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-12, REQ-13, REQ-14) appear to be implemented in the diff. Frontend files rename 'LTMs'/'ltms' to 'Spear Mace'/'spearMace' and 'Pot'/'pot' to 'Diamond SMP Nethop Spear'/'diamondSmpNethopSpear' across CategoryTabs.tsx, mockData.ts, AddPlayerModal.tsx, TierBadge.tsx, useQueries.ts. Backend main.mo uses the new keys in RawRankingData and rankingCategories. migration.mo defines OldRawRankingData with 'ltms'/'pot' fields and NewRawRankingData with 'spearMace'/'diamondSmpNethopSpear', though the actual data migration logic in migration.mo's run() function is a no-op (returns old unchanged), which means existing 'ltms'/'pot' data would NOT be migrated to the new keys.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "migration.mo maps any existing 'ltms' data to 'spearMace' and any existing 'pot' data to 'diamondSmpNethopSpear'.",
      "reason": "The migration.mo run() function simply returns the old actor state unchanged ('old' passed directly as NewActor), meaning no actual data migration from 'ltms' to 'spearMace' or 'pot' to 'diamondSmpNethopSpear' is performed for existing stored data.",
